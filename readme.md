## Reflection
This project provided an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of REST API development and testing, along with hands-on experience in managing a version-controlled codebase using Git. Resolving the issues, such as username and password validation and handling edge cases in profile updates, enhanced my problem-solving skills and taught me how to approach API functionality holistically. By increasing test coverage, I learned the importance of writing thorough test cases to ensure application robustness and reliability, which will be invaluable for real-world projects.

One of the most significant learning experiences was managing merge conflicts and handling divergent branches in Git. Through this process, I gained confidence in resolving conflicts, rebasing branches, and maintaining a clean commit history. Additionally, working with Docker and deploying the application in a containerized environment gave me insights into modern software deployment practices. Overall, this project reinforced the value of collaboration, code quality, and rigorous testing, which are essential for building scalable and maintainable applications.

The challenges faced, such as debugging database connections and dealing with asynchronous operations, taught me to utilize tools like logs and error messages effectively. Moreover, documenting the resolved issues and reflecting on the solutions helped solidify my learning. This assignment has significantly contributed to my technical and collaborative skills, preparing me for future development and QA roles.
